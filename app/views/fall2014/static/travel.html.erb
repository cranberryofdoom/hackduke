      <div class="container-small">
        <p>Because there is a football game against Virginia Tech on Saturday, Duke will go into checkpoint mode at 11:30AM. This will not allow any vehicles to enter the campus via the main point of entrance, which is via Towerview Road onto Science Drive.</p>
        <p>All vehicles must be in the PG4/Bryan Center parking lot by 11:30AM. Because of expected traffic due to the game, we strongly suggest all participants, sponsors and mentors to leave early and arrive on time.</p>
        <p>If it is past 11:30AM, and Duke is in checkpoint mode, you must enter campus via Erwin Road and onto Research Drive. At this point, you will recieve a pass to proceed to PG4/Bryan Center parking lot.</p>
        <p>The parking lot for the Bryan Center can be reached on the intersection of Towerview Road and Science Drive. The fee for parking is $5 for the day and $20 for overnight stays. Cash only.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, because our venue has a limit of 500 participants and we have a limited amount of funding, we can't get all 1200+ of our registrants to come to HackDuke.
          <br><br><strong>Registrants who go to schools that do not have a bus provided for them and are out of state will be selected to participate in HackDuke.</strong>
          <br><br>These participants, who will most likely be traveling by plane, will be eligible for a reimbursement of up to $200.
          <br>They will be notified by email by <strong>October 19th</strong> about their status and will have until <strong>October 26th</strong> to confirm their spot and whether they need travel reimbursement.
          <br><br>If you did not get an email regarding confirmation of participation, you can opt to be put on the waitlist, so that when we find out that we have room for more participants, we will be selecting from the waitlist.
